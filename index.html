                <p class="lead">Samantha Jo Remington of Superior passed away suddenly on Saturday, February 27th surrounded by her family. She was born on June 12, 1992 in Denver to Barry and Brigitte Remington. She is also survived by siblings: Cassie, Carly, and Jack; grandparents: Paul and Pam Benedetti of Boulder, the late Wayne D. Remington, Marilyn and Rod Stone of Lafayette; and numerous aunts, uncles and cousins.</p>
                <p>ï¿¼She graduated from Monarch High School in 2011 and earned her Early Childhood Teacher Certificate from Front Range Community College. She was recently employed at Mt. View Preschool, the same preschool she attended. Sammy was blessed to be a two-time heart transplant recipient. In her lifetime she helped bring awareness to organ donation through the Donor Alliance. She was a member of the American Heart Association and helped promote heart health by speaking to children in elementary schools. She also modeled in several fashion shows, including AHA&#8217;s &#8220;Go Red for Women&#8221; on February, 20th. Sammy was part of the &#8220;Buffs 4 Life&#8221; family and enjoyed volunteering at their fundraising activities. She was instrumental in starting the Samantha Remington Angel Heart Foundation which provides charitable grants to children and their families who are facing financial hardship due to the high cost of life-saving medical procedures.</p>
                <p>Sammy loved spending time with her family and friends &#8211; going to Buff games and movies, babysitting, shopping, and watching her siblings&#8217; sporting events. She also enjoyed traveling, most recently on a family cruise. She will be remembered for her tremendous strength and courage through her transplants and many surgeries. She was a brave warrior with an angelic smile, infectious laugh who, more than anything, loved being surrounded by her family and friends.</p>
                <p>Donations can be made to the Samantha Remington Angel Heart Foundation (which was created after her 2nd transplant to benefit others who&#8217;ve had challenging health conditions like Sammy&#8217;s) Samantha was excited to someday oversee the foundation herself, and her family is committed to growing the foundation in her honor.
